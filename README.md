# ExpressProject

## Description
This is a project I am making for practicing my express skills. It was just a random project which has started to develop more and more. I have created a todoList with time coordination within two days and I am hoping to add many more projects to this same repository.

### Prerequisites
You need [nodejs](http://nodejs.org) and [mongoDB](http://mongodb.org) to run this project.
You can install them easily by reading the instructions at their site and they are cross platform.

### Running on your own computer
To run this on your own computer Clone this repository and run

`**npm install**`

in the directory where `server.js` is included.


#### Contributions
Please make a pull request. It'll be more than appreciated.
